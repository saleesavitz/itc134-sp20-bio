Welcome to my page, my name is Salee Savitz.
Coming San Jose Ca, the Silicon Valley, I was raised by the internet. Like most people in thier mid twenties, I am just now getting to know my parents. I am a proud student at YearUp, honing in my skills related to testing of technologies. Software and hardware repair have been hobbies and entrepreneurial ventures. I am excited to progress as a proffesional and contribute the best version of me to the Tech world.
