Welcome to the trainwreck that is a single mother of two, navigate college for the first time through Zoom fueled by overthinking and run on sentences. Welp. I have worked as a county mail clerk for six months...My highest score on my GED was Reasoning through Language Arts but thats becuase I described my journey learning how to repair my families computer as an epic quest through a fantasy medival world. I am afraid of what I might do if I wrote my own bio.
